Recent skirmishes with rogue Klingon factions have left the Federation on guard against a possible Klingon Civil War.  The Federation must keep this from happening!  To complicate matters, the rogue Klingons seem to have been forced on the offensive by a sudden and mysterious loss of one of their main installations.

As such, Captain Jean Luc Picard has been sent with the Enterprise-E and several other Sovereign class sister ships to bolster the Federation presence at Deep Space 5 near the Klingon border.  The rules of engagement are simple: if fired upon, return fire.

Follow the asteroid fields to the Federation base and defend it from rogue Klingons.  If you encounter friendly Klingons, they will assist.  You may only know if they're friendly by whether or not they fire upon you!

Once the base is secure, try to eliminate other rogue Klingon elements and find out what strange force wiped out the Klingon base.
