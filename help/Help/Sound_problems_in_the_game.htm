              <p><font face="Arial">1. Make sure your sound card is 100% DirectX
              7 compatible. Using a non-DirectX 7-compatible sound card and
              drivers may result in sound problems.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">2. Make sure your speakers are plugged in
              correctly and turned on. Also make sure the volume is set at an
              audible level.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">3. Your sound drivers for Windows 95 may
              require updating. Check the installation and setup parameters of
              your sound card using Device Manager in Windows 95.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">If you purchased your sound card before the
              release of Windows 95, you may obtain updated drivers from a
              variety of places. Most hardware retailers have access to the most
              recent drivers. Additionally, most manufacturers maintain a
              website, which contains the latest drivers for free downloading.
              Drivers are also available on CompuServe, America Online, The
              Microsoft Network, and other popular online networks. Many
              manufacturers also maintain a direct-dial BBS with up-to-date
              drivers. A list of <a href="../Vendor/Sound_Card_Manufacturers_List.htm">Sound
              Card Manufacturers</a> and their Technical Support and BBS numbers
              is available in this document. Please make every effort to install
              the latest drivers before calling <a href="Customer_Support.htm">Activision
              Customer Support</a>.</font></p>
