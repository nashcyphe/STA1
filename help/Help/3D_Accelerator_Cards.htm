Notes:</h3>

<b>Diamond Monster I</b>:&nbsp;  At the time of it's release, there were graphic anomalies observed with the Diamond Monster I video card.  These anomalies include extreme graphical glitches, sound corruptions, and unstable gameplay.  It was observed by QA that this problem was alleviated with the use of 3dfx reference drivers.  Please read the note below about reference drivers below before installing them.

<p><b>Diamond Monster II</b>:&nbsp; At the time of it’s release, there were
graphic anomalies observed with the Diamond Monster II video card.&nbsp;
These anomalies are isolated to the radar grid not being present.&nbsp;
It was observed by QA that this problem was alleviated with the use of
3dfx reference drivers.&nbsp; Please read the note below about reference
drivers below before installing them.
<p><b>Diamond Monster Fusion</b>:&nbsp; At the time of it’s release, there
were graphic anomalies observed with the Diamond Monster Fusion video card.&nbsp;
These anomalies are isolated to blocky terrain, grids appearing on shadows,
and slow performance.&nbsp; It was observed by QA that this problem was
alleviated with the use of 3dfx reference drivers.&nbsp; Please read the
note below about reference drivers below before installing them.
<p><b>ATI Rage 128</b>:&nbsp; At the time of it’s release, there were graphic
anomalies observed with the ATI Rage 128 video card.&nbsp; These anomalies
are isolated to the radar grid not being present.&nbsp; It was observed
by QA that this problem was alleviated with the use of ATI Quake 3 drivers.&nbsp;

<p><b>**Note on reference drivers**</b>
<p>Video and 3D Cards are a combination of a core chipset and additional electronics added by the card manufacturer to implement special features outside of the capabilities of the core chipset (i.e. Diamond uses the Voodoo 2 chipset by 3Dfx as the core of their Diamond Monster 2).

<p>Reference drivers are drivers made for the core chipset by the chipset manufacturer. They tend to only support features that are supported by the core chipset itself. The card manufacturer uses these drivers as the starting point to create the manufacturer's drivers for their card. Manufacturer's drivers typically are more fully featured, and support all features built into the card.

<p>It is not always a safe assumption that the reference drivers are the best drivers for your card, since some of the features added by the manufacturer of the card may require a substantial change in the reference drivers before they will work on the card.

<p>A good example of this is the Diamond Stealth II S220. When it was released, the modifications Diamond had made on the card made it substantially different from a driver point of view. When the original Rendition Verite 2100 reference drivers were used to try to run it, they would cause crashes and instability in Windows. This says nothing about the quality of the drivers, only that they were for the core chipset, not the whole card.

<p>Star Trek: Armada does not support video or 3D card reference drivers. It is suggested that code released DirectX 7 compliant drivers be used. We will however note where we have seen improved stability and performance in the reference drivers as an indication of what should be available when that version of the reference drivers is integrated into your manufacturer's drivers.
