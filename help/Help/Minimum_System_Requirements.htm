IMPORTANT NOTE: Star Trek: Armada™ uses
Microsoft DirectX® 7 technology, and requires
that your system have the most updated Windows® 95 or 98-compatible
drivers for CD-ROM, video card, sound card, and input devices.
<br>

Star Trek: Armada™ may have trouble working with some
1993 or earlier Matsushita CD-ROM drives. These CD-ROM drives have trouble
reading beyond 63 minutes on CDs, and Star Trek: Armada™ uses the full CD. These
drives were sold under the names of Panasonic, JVC, Reveal, Creative Labs
and Plextor. Gameplay may occasionally slow down and the CD-ROM drive will
be accessed constantly. We highly recommend that you upgrade to a newer
CD-ROM drive to avoid problems with other programs in the future.
<br><br>
* 3D ACCELERATOR CARD RECOMMENDED<br>
A 100% DirectX 7 or higher compliant 3D video card and driver with z-buffering capability is
strongly recommended.  Star Trek: Armada uses Microsoft's® Direct 3D® to support 3D hardware
acceleration.  It has been tested on many, but not all of the major cards incorporating the
chipsets listed below.  Some 3D accelerator card brands utilizing the chipsets whose names
appear on this box may not be fully compatible with the 3D acceleration features utilized by
Star Trek: Armada.  For a list of cards and drivers that have been tested, please visit
